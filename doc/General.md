Goal of this project was to make an HMI for controlling klipper.

Goals:

* Only one cable to the device that runs klipper (e.G. Raspberry PI).
* Having a hardware "Emergency Stop" Button.

Using:
* 4x20 Character LCD (HD44780)
* 8 Buttons that can be used in Klipper to perform any defined action.
* 7 LEDs that can also be individually controlled from Klipper.
* Rotary encoder with push button for controlling the menu.
